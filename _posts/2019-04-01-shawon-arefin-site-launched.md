Finally restarted the project of putting my old site back togather. I used 
JONATHAN MCGLONE's github pages guide to put togather this site. This is powered by 
[jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I used markdown to author my posts.
I am planning to use this and maintain this to learn HTML, CSS and Github Markdown (.md).
